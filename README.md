[Schematic](schematic/schematic.pdf)

## Software

The firmware is written in Microchip C.  The user can set the required output voltage and current via the two rotary encoders and see the actual output voltage and current on the front LCD display.  Voltage and current are set by a filtered PWM signal generated by the PIC.
